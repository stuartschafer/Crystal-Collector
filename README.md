# Crystal Game

Select a level.  Then click on pictures.  Each picture is worth a certain amount of points.  Your goal is to hit the target goal exactly. (Can't go over)

Each level gets increasingly difficult.  Please note that you might think some levels are "broken", but they aren't.  They can be "tricky" to figure out.  Levels 7 and 8 are espescially tough.

You can also click on the extra help button if you need it.

Good Luck!!!
